# modAL
Modular Active Learning framework for Python3

## Introduction
ModAL is an active learning framework for Python3, designed with *modularity, flexibility* and *extensibility* in mind.
Built on top of scikit-learn, it allows you to rapidly create active learning workflows with nearly complete freedom.
What is more, you can easily replace parts with your custom built solutions, allowing you to design novel algorithms
with ease.
